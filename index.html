        The goal of this assignment is was to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website while
        learning the skills necessary to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, 
        create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a 
        responsive website based on those prototypes.

          This website for Toronto Cupcake was chosen because it does not necessarily 
          have the best layout for users to easily navigate and 
          overall seems a bit outdated

                    This websites design does not lend itself to being very 
                    user friendly especially if they are first time users
                    because it heavily relies on users having pre-existing 
                    knowledge of what certain icons do and the users intuitively 
                    having the desire to explore the page and scroll through the website
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In addition, the location of the hamburger icon is in an awkward place and quite small.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The side bar that pops up also provides many 
                    options of which can overwhelm the user and 
                    confuse them as they are not very descriptive
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The text on the website is also repetitive and 
                    has typos which is not the greatest for readability 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The interaction with the sidebar is poorly structured
                    because it some options have dropdowns that cover other options
                    on the side bar.

                  </li>

                </ul>

                    First Time users: It might be hard for them to figure out where 
                    the different tabs are located. This is because users need to scroll all the 
                    way down to see the different links to different pages or intuitively 
                    know that the hamburger icon means that a sidebar will pop up and have 
                    the different options
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once people visit the site more often, they will be able to easily 
                    figure out where to click to find the different options that the website offers

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Even if the users are very proficient 
                    with the current website, it is not very efficient, there are 
                    2 clicks to get to the options or they need to scroll down 
                    to the bottom of the page in order to find the tabs. 
                  </li>

                <ul class="list">
                  <li>
                    The memorability of this website is not very good because  
                    the hamburger icon is small and in an awkward place.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Because the website landing page does not exactly 
                    fit the viewport height, users need to remember that 
                    options are at the bottom of the page and need to scroll in order to see them.
                    (The screenshots are zoomed out in order to capture the whole website)

              <td>

                  <li>
                    The conceptual model for this website is that the 
                    hamburger icon implies to the user that it is clickable 
                    and that there are more options.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The scroll bar on the side of the window indicates 
                    that there is more to the page and that some of the text is cut off
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>

          Some of the warnings that were detected was 
          that there are device specific interactions. 
          For example they told users to click on a link and 
          the link was repetitive which may cause confusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another problem is that although some of the images have 
          alternative descriptions, they are not very descriptive and 
          not all the images have alternative descriptions

          This project helped me learn how the design and prototype process works, starting from an 
          existing product and analyzing how it could be improved and then creating
          different stages of prototypes 
        </li>
        <li>
          I was also able to think about how to take designs and actually implement them in code form in 
          order to make the designs a reality. While I was designing I had to keep in mind the 
          people that I would be designing for and take into account accessibility.
